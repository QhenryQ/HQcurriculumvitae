I am a perpetual, quick learner and keen to explore the realm of modern agriculture and data science. I am deeply excited about the time we live in and the rate at which data is being generated, analyzed and transformed. I am well versed with a few tools for dealing with data in crop genetics and agronomy, and looking forward to put what I have learned into modern agricultural practices.
